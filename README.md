This is my implementation for Quiz Master technial exam from Quipper. It has mini enrollment feature that allows students to to enroll with their teachers. I have just used SQLite for the database.

In order to try testing or using the application, the user has to

- Create account (choose between "Teacher" or "User") depends on what type of CRUD the user would like to try
- If "Teacher", features available is CRUD for quizzes.
- if "Student", the user has to enroll first before answering the quizzes. He/she may choose among the teachers for answering quizzes.
- Student may review the quiz he/she took and can try answering again.

HAVE FUN!
